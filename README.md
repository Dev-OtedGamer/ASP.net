This repository contains a basic ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application that demonstrates the foundational structure of a modern web app using Razor Pages and the .NET Core framework.

## 🔧 Key Features:
✅ Uses the WebApplication builder pattern introduced in .NET 6+

This was great starter project to understand how Razor Pages apps are structured, configured, and run in a real-world setting. It was ideal for me to learn and develope while getting hands-on experience with ASP.NET Core’s modern approach to web development.
